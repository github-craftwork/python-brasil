# Part 3: Continuous Integration (CI) 

_Note: The following section requires you to create a repository on your own account. You will need to ensure you have access to the [Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) page._

Next let’s start a new project in your personal repos (**not the github-craftwork org**) using the [github-craftwork/ci-template](https://github.com/github-craftwork/ci-template/generate). The contents of the project include have been taken from the Plurasight Intro that finds out what the current week number it is today.

**Create a CI pull requests**
To develop a GitHub Workflow process that employs Actions to automate the Continuous 
Integration process, you can begin by adding starter workflow file to the `.github` directory. On the initial view of your repository, find and navigate to the **Actions** tab.

On the Actions page you should see 3 Python workflow options. Find the Python Application workflow option and click the `Set up this workflow` button.

_Note: The [actions/starter-workflows](https://github.com/actions/starter-workflows) repository contains many sample workflow files._

The Actions Workflow wizard will install the sample workflow selected in your repo within the `.github` folder. You may edit the name of the file and its contents on the screen provided.

Commit the `pythonpackage.yml` file to the master branch to complete this process of creating our first CI workflow. 

The `.github/workflows/` folder will include the contents from below:
name: Python application

```
on: [push]

jobs:
  build:

    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v1
    - name: Set up Python 3.7
      uses: actions/setup-python@v1
      with:
        python-version: 3.7
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: |
        python -m pip install --upgrade pip
        pip install -r requirements.txt
    - name: Lint with flake8
      run: |
        pip install flake8
        # stop the build if there are Python syntax errors or undefined names
        flake8 . --count --select=E9,F63,F7,F82 --show-source --statistics
        # exit-zero treats all errors as warnings. The GitHub editor is 127 chars wide
        flake8 . --count --exit-zero --max-complexity=10 --max-line-length=127 --statistics
    - name: Test with pytest
      run: |
        pip install pytest
        pytest
```

_Take note that our workflow is running a strategy with 3 versions of python. This will be important to know later._ 

Because your new Actions CI is running on everything push, you should already have a workflow running.

Note that we  will need to a test to run as part of our CI, Find the `index.test.js` file with the contents from below:

```py
# tests/00_empty_test.py
def test_empty():
    """
    PyTest tests are callables whose names start with "test"
    (by default)

    It looks for them in modules whose name contains "test"
    (by default)
    """
    pass

```

The result of that last push to master should look like this image:

Add the above test using the UI, but instead of committing directly to the master branch, open a pull request to trigger you CI workflow again.. 

We have not created a pull request until now, so please take note that you can see all the workflows triggering through a GitHub [Check Suite](https://developer.github.com/v3/checks/). All Action Workflows are being powered by this API feature. And since we are on the subject the GitHub Actions bot is built on the [GitHub App](https://developer.github.com/apps/) framework that has already popularized by a number of our [Marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace) and Ecosystem partners.

Once all test have passed, merge the pull request and let us move on to complete the next step. 
    
## Part 3b: Draft and Auto publish a release
CI is often coupled with the idea of Continuous Delivery (CD). The next two sections will cover automating your projects release management.

**Add release workflow**
You can use the [Release Drafter GitHub Action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/release-drafter) in a [GitHub Actions Workflow](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-github-actions) by configuring a YAML-based workflow file, e.g. `.github/workflows/release-management.yml`, with the following:


    name: Release Management
    
    on:
      push:
        # branches to consider in the event; optional, defaults to all
        branches:
          - master
    
    jobs:
      update_draft_release:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        steps:
          # Drafts your next Release notes as Pull Requests are merged into "master"
          - uses: toolmantim/release-drafter@v5.2.0
            env:
              GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}

Once you’ve added Release Drafter to your repository, it must be enabled by adding a `.github/release-drafter.yml` configuration file to each repository.

**Add release template**
Create the following `.github/release-drafter.yml`  file in a repository and commit to your master branch:

    template: |
      ## What’s Changed
    
      $CHANGES

**Make a change**
Navigate to any file in the repo and replace the contents with your something else. 

Change:  Swap out my name with your handle and commit that to master.

As pull requests are merged, a draft release is kept up-to-date listing the changes, ready to publish when you’re ready:

![Screenshot of generated draft release](https://github.com/toolmantim/release-drafter/raw/master/design/screenshot.png)


To test this workflow, edit your draft using the existing tag created for it. Once completed, move on to the next step in the project to complete this step.

**Publish Python Package**
You can publish you Python Package by using the starter templating in the Actions wizard.

**Create a PR for this workflow**
Commit this workflow to a new branch and open the pull request.
